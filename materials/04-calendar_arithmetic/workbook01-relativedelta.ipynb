    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many relationships between datetimes that we would like to express but that cannot be expressed with `timedelta`. One of the reasons for this is *ambiguity*. In addition to the ambiguity of absolute vs. wall times, the lengths of certain common units are poorly defined - how long is \"one month from now\" or \"one year from now\", for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "`dateutil` provides the `relativedelta` class for calendrical operations where the duration may depend on the starting datetime, so, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"one month from now\"\n",
    "- \"one year from now\"\n",
    "- \"next monday\"\n",
    "- \"until the third Thursday of the month\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A `relativedelta` is constructed of *absolute* and *relative* arguments where absolute arguments are specified with *singular* keywords (e.g. `year`, `day`) and relative arguments are specified with *plural* keywords (e.g. `years`, `days`). Be careful of confusing these, as it is a common source of bugs."
